description: Spontaneous animal behaviour is built from action modules that are concatenated
  by the brain into sequences1,2. However, the neural mechanisms that guide the composition
  of naturalistic, self-motivated behaviour remain unknown. Here we show that dopamine
  systematically fluctuates in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously
  express sub-second behavioural modules, despite the absence of task structure, sensory
  cues or exogenous reward. Photometric recordings and calibrated closed-loop optogenetic
  manipulations during open field behaviour demonstrate that DLS dopamine fluctuations
  increase sequence variation over seconds, reinforce the use of associated behavioural
  modules over minutes, and modulate the vigour with which modules are expressed,
  without directly influencing movement initiation or moment-to-moment kinematics.
  Although the reinforcing effects of optogenetic DLS dopamine manipulations vary
  across behavioural modules and individual mice, these differences are well predicted
  by observed variation in the relationships between endogenous dopamine and module
  use. Consistent with the possibility that DLS dopamine fluctuations act as a teaching
  signal, mice build sequences during exploration as if to maximize dopamine. Together,
  these findings suggest a model in which the same circuits and computations that
  govern action choices in structured tasks have a key role in sculpting the content
  of unconstrained, high-dimensional, spontaneous behaviour.
